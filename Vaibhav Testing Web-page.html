                "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
                 dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms 
                 of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
                  foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal 
                  blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of
                   will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and 
                   pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In
                   a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when 
                   nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every 
                   pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain 
                   circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of 
                   business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be 
                   repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always

                       <i> "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
                pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete 
                account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great 
                explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.</i><b> No one 
                rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, 
                but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
                encounter consequences that are extremely painful.</b>
